    <p><h2>Html is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML is a full-form <u>Hypertext markup language</u> that requires closing tags after opening.For instance,
         <!--<h1></h1-->contains six headers. 
    <!--<h1></h1>,<h2></h2>,<h3></h3>,<h4></h4>,<h5></h5>,<h6></h6>--> 
        Using these tags, you can change your headings or paragraphs in many ways Essentially, the purpose of these tags is to make any word appear shorter than the previous words.<br>For example, when we visit an eye specialist, he makes us read a board.The approach written on the board was produced using HTML headers.<hr><h3>The tags we are using in this are paragraph , bold, italic, emphasize, mark, horizontal, break, tags are used to form the beginning of their own words.<br> why they are used, you must be knowing from the meaning of their words, so here we will only tell you why they use superscript and subscript.</h3><br><h4>Often we have memorized formulas in chemistry, of which the simplest formula for water is H²O, so here's the little 2 you see To write this, we use the subscript in HTML, which has the tags sub </h4><h5>H<sub>2</sub>O</h5><br><h4>Now I will tell you here why I use superscript and why we often read numericals in Math which is written something like x² + y² So we use superscript to write what's in it, whose tags are sup</h4><h5>X<sup>2</sup>+ Y<sup>2</sup></h5>
