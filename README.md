# Html5-1st-Assigment

First HTML Assignment

This project is my first step into web development, I explored basic HTML tags such as paragraphs, headings, bold, italics, superscript, subscript, and horizontal rules. The purpose was to understand how these tags work to format content, making it more readable and structured. This simple project highlights the use of subscript and superscript tags, as seen in chemical formulas (e.g., H₂O) and mathematical expressions (e.g., x² + y²). This foundation is the beginning of my journey into web development, and I’m excited to build on this knowledge in future projects.
